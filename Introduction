INTRODUCTION 

This assignment helped to practice and strengthen Python programming skills through real-world style problems. 
The four exercises focus on different areas of Python that are commonly used in Data Science and AI, such as working 
with dates, performing mathematical calculations, handling files, processing data, and using external APIs.

The first exercise involves creating an age calculator that takes a user’s birth date, checks for valid input, 
calculates the age, and displays the date in different formats. The second exercise focuses on generating prime 
numbers within a given range, which helps in understanding loops, functions, and input validation. The third 
exercise deals with reading and processing student marks from a file, calculating overall scores, assigning grades, 
and organizing the data in a structured format using NumPy. The final exercise introduces working with real-time 
data by fetching weather information from an online API, analyzing it, and saving the results in a file.

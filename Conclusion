CONCLUSION
By completing these four exercises, I gained hands-on experience in applying Python to solve different types of problems. 
The assignment helped me understand how to validate inputs, handle errors properly, and write clean, well-commented code. 
It also improved my ability to break down problems into smaller steps and implement them using functions and loops.

Working with files, NumPy arrays, and live API data provided valuable exposure to real-world programming scenarios that are
important in Data Science and AI. This assignment not only strengthened my technical skills but also increased my confidence 
in building Python programs that are reliable, readable, and practical.
